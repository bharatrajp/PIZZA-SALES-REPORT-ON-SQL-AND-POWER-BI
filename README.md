 Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project
## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive Pizza Sales Data Analysis project conducted using Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI. The project involves importing raw data, creating a database, writing queries for data documentation, and generating insightful reports. The data is processed and visualized to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) and address specific problem statements.

## Project Workflow

1. **Import Raw Data Using MS SQL Server:**
   - Utilized MS SQL Server to import raw pizza sales data.

2. **Database Creation:**
   - Developed a structured database in MS SQL Server for efficient data management.

3. **Querying and Data Documentation:**
   - Executed SQL queries to capture results for data documentation.
   - The captured results in MS SQL Server act as support for Power BI analysis.

4. **Connect MS SQL Server to Power BI:**
   - Established a connection between MS SQL Server and Power BI for seamless data transfer.

5. **Data Cleaning in Power BI:**
   - Implemented data cleaning processes in Power BI using transformation functions.

6. **Data Processing:**
   - Applied advanced data processing techniques to extract meaningful insights.

7. **Data Visualization:**
   - Created visually appealing charts using advanced tools to represent trends and patterns.

8. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
   - a. Total Revenue: Sum of the total price of all pizza sales.
   - b. Average Amount Spent per Order: Total revenue divided by the total number of orders.
   - c. Total Pizzas Sold: Aggregate count of pizzas sold.
   - d. Total Number of Orders: Count of all orders placed.
   - e. Average Number of Pizzas Sold per Order: Number of pizzas sold divided by the number of orders.

## Problem Statement and Chart Requirements

1. **Daily Trend for Total Orders:**
   - Bar chart displaying the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period.

2. **Monthly Trends for Total Orders:**
   - Line chart illustrating the daily trend of total orders throughout the day.

3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:**
   - Pie chart showing the distribution of sales across different pizza categories.

4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size:**
   - Pie chart representing the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes.

5. **Total Pizza Sold by Pizza Category:**
   - Funnel chart comparing the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category.

6. **Top 5 Best Sellers:**
   - Bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity, and total orders.

7. **Bottom 5 Best Sellers:**
   - Bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity, and total orders.

## Data Details

- The pizza sales data is for the year 2021 and comprises 10 columns.
